1. I implemented header_14 from Hero.
2. All of the components look good on different screen resolutions.
3. I’m validating the correctness of the email, password, and terms inputs using Zod.
4. I’m sending requests to a non-existent endpoint and simulating the delay.
5. Predefined combinations:
- Email: "success@example.com", Password: "password123" - for success
- Email: "blocked@example.com", Password: "password123" - for email error
6. I’m handling errors, communicating action status to the user through toast notifications, and preventing button abuse.
7. I’m storing the login state in context.
8. A positive response sets the state to logged in.
9. I implemented pricing_table_5 from Pricing Tables, which replaces the login screen if the user is logged in.
10. Components include animations.
